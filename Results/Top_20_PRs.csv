rails-31727,1,1,Refactor migration to move migrations paths to connection,"Rails has some support for multiple databases but it can be hard to handle migrations with those. The easiest way to implement multiple databases is to contain migrations into their own folder (""db/migrate"" for the primary db and ""db/seconddb_migrate"" for the second db). Without this you would need to write code that allowed you to switch connections in migrations. I can tell you from experience that is not a fun way to implement multiple databases.
This refactoring is a pre-requisite for implementing other features related to parallel testing and improved handling for multiple databases. The refactoring here moves the class methods from the Migrator class into it's own new class MigrationContext. The goal was to move the migrations_paths method off of the Migrator class and onto the connection. This allows users to do the following in their
database.yml:
development:
  adapter: mysql2
  username: root
  password:
development_seconddb:
  adapter: mysql2
  username: root
  password:
  migrations_paths: ""db/second_db_migrate""
Migrations for the seconddb can now be store in the db/second_db_migrate directory. Migrations for the primary database are stored in db/migrate"". The refactoring here drastically reduces the internal API for migrations since we don't need to pass migrations_paths around to every single method. Additionally this change does not require any Rails applicationsto make changes unless they want to use the new public API. All of the
class methods from the Migrator class were nodoc'd except for the
migrations_paths and migrations_path getter/setters respectively.

kubernetes-53218,1,1,Adding e2e test for statefulsets for vsphere cloud provider,"What this PR does / why we need it:
This PR adds a new e2e test for statefulsets for vSphere cloud Provider.
Test does following tasks.

Create a storage class with thin diskformat.
Create nginx service.
Create nginx statefulsets with 3 replicas.
Wait until all Pods are ready and PVCs are bounded with PV.
Verify volumes are accessible in all statefulsets pods with creating empty file.
Scale down statefulsets to 2 replicas.
Scale up statefulsets to 3 replicas.
Scale down statefulsets to 0 replicas and delete all pods.
Delete all PVCs from the test namespace.
Delete the storage class.

There is possibility that device name(/dev/sd*) would change when attach/detach data disk in Azure VM according to  Troubleshoot Linux VM device name change.

Special notes for your reviewer:
In a customer case, customer is unable to use azure disk in StatefulSet since /dev/sd* changed after detach/attach disk.
we are using /dev/sd*(code is here) to ""mount -bind"" k8s path, while /dev/sd* could be changed when VM is attach/detaching data disks, see Troubleshoot Linux VM device name change

This adds support for Darwin/FreeBSD/OpenBSD where the output


does not contain several fields that Linux emits.


While here it adds the from field which is reliably populated in the BSD implementation. Local logins are tracked as - or  the X Windows display.


Due to the fact the Linux implementation of w emits nothing for local logins it makes the output harder to parse. So skip printing from on Linux entirely.

Part1
Special notes for your reviewer:
Currently, it seems that func IsResourceNameValid is not used outside and could be changed to internal.
But as Renaud commented, it is designed for potential usage from users outside.
And I could not find a better position to place the func, except for file utils.go. So, shall we just retain the utils.go file, and maybe for possible expansion in the future?

I found it useful because I were needed to add seen_at and some more attributes related to my application and were needed to extend default DatabaseNotification model. And instead just modifying attributes in DatabaseChannel class on notification creation, we need to copy-paste send method. That means that if there will be changes in send method in the future - we will require to update extended implementations.
With this change we can do:
<?php

namespace App\Notification\Channels;

use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

kubernetes-53239,1,1,Correct APIGroup for RoleBindingBuilder Subjects,"This change corrects RoleBindingBuilder to use the RBAC API group with users and groups as subjects (service accounts use the empty string since they are in the legacy core group).  This is based on the defaulting in pkg/apis/rbac/v1/defaults.go#SetDefaults_Subject.  This is required because the bootstrap RBAC data is built with these helpers and does not go through defaulting, whereas the data retrieved from the server has already gone through defaulting.  This can lead to the reconciliation code incorrectly adding duplicate subjects because it believes that they are missing (since the API groups do not match).

Can't locate object method ""TIESCALAR"" via package ""IO::Pager::Unbuffered""
at /nix/store/y5fas16nfwaqsz5wm1midmw5h7i7vf5b-perl-IO-Pager-0.06/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.24.2/IO/Pager/Unbuffered.pm line 26.

It turns out that upgrading IOPager to 0.39 resolves the bug. Besides sqitch, there don't seem to be any other packages in nixpkgs that use IOPager.

terraform-16377,2,1,[WIP] module provider inheritance,"The primary goal of this PR is to define the new provider inheritance model, while hoisting the provider inheritance mechanisms into the config itself. The new providers field in the module block allows users to declare a provider configuration to apply within a module. Since this new inheritance mechanism is configuration based, it is much simpler to apply all the inheritance rules within the config, rather than searching for provider configurations during graph evaluation.


This also adds the version field to the module block, though it is not yet used.


Orphaned modules:


While the config inheritance is fully solved here, the ""adoption"" of orphaned resources when they have no module configuration is broken. The tests to handle this are commented out, but need to be resolved before 0.11.


There needs to be a distinction between config inheritance and provider adoption. It may make sense to only create missing providers at the root level and attach and orphaned resources regardless of path, but that is a more intrusive patch to the graph, and breaks many assumption about provider always having the same path as their resources. It may also be feasible to have the missing providers be a proxy to the root level provider, but that can wait as well.",new_feature,

react-10967,2,1,Fix website font flicker,"I tried moving the TypeKit tag from the bottom of the <body> to the <head> but this didn't resolve the flicker. According to the docs this is actually expected. TBH this flicker existed on the legacy site as well so I'm not sure how high-priority it is but it is annoying.
So I'm now leaning towards removing TypeKit entirely and just using sans-serif font. Joe is going to circle back to this tomorrow and try out some other fonts that don't require using TypeKit (eg San Francisco). I think we could merge this PR for now (to remove the flicker) and then merge his later (to make things look better).
